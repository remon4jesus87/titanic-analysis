\# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis



\## Project Description

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Titanic dataset using Python.

The goal is to clean and organize the data, handle missing values, convert data types, generate summary statistics, and visualize key patterns related to survival rates.



\## Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset from Kaggle.

It includes information about passengers such as gender, age, passenger class, and survival status.



\## Tools and Libraries

\- Python 3.x

\- Pandas

\- Seaborn

\- Matplotlib



\## Project Steps

1\. \*\*Data Loading\*\*: Import the Titanic dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

2\. \*\*Data Cleaning\*\*: Handle missing values in columns like `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`. Convert categorical variables to appropriate data types.

3\. \*\*Summary Statistics\*\*: Generate descriptive statistics for numeric columns and analyze survival rates by gender and passenger class.

4\. \*\*Data Visualization\*\*:

   - Bar plots for survival rates by gender and passenger class.

   - Heatmap showing correlations between numerical features.

   - Distribution plots for `Age` and survival by age.



\## How to Run

1\. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

2\. Install required libraries if not already installed:
